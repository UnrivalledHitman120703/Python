    @staticmethod
    # A static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of the class. It is a
    # method that is shared among all instances of a class.
    # A static method is bound to the class and not the object of the class. It canâ€™t access or modify
    # class state. A static method does not receive an implicit first argument.
    def adding_things2(num1, num2):
        return num1 + num2


# Creating instances of PlayerCharacter
# player2 will have the default parameters assigned to it
player1 = PlayerCharacter('Benedict Hope', 53)
player2 = PlayerCharacter("Scott Mariani", 55)

# Calling class methods
player1.shout()
player2.shout()

# Calling a @classmethod

# Calling a @staticmethod
