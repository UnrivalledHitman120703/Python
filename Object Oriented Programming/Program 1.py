# Creating a class
class BigObject:
    pass


# Creating an instance of the class BigObject
obj1 = BigObject()

# Some introductory examples:
print(type(None))
print(type(True))
print(type(5))
print(type(5.5))
print(type('Hi'))
print(type([]))
print(type(()))
print(type({}))
print(type(obj1))

# Output
# <class 'NoneType'>
# <class 'bool'>
# <class 'int'>
# <class 'float'>
# <class 'str'>
# <class 'list'>
# <class 'tuple'>
# <class 'dict'>

# Inference
# Here, we can see that all the types are "class" + "respective date-types"

# Definition
# A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and
# functions that operate on that data. A class can be thought of as a template for creating objects, which
# are instances of the class.
